**TODO**
- Create services: ReportEntryGenerator
- Report should have been generated in parseable format (e.g. in csv) in case for future processing needs

**Questions**
- Consider to use one of the common CSV libraries to stick with CSV RFC!
- LogRotation: what if a given process END entry written in the subsequent files
